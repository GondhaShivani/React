//Certainly! Short-circuiting is a behavior in JavaScript where the evaluation of an expression stops as soon as the result is determined. This is often used in conjunction with logical operators && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and the nullish coalescing operator ??.

//Here are examples for each:
/* 

// 1--------------------------Logical AND (&&):

const value1 = true;
const value2 = false;

// Using && to check both conditions
const result = value1 && value2;
console.log(result); // Output: false

 */

// 2---------------------Logical OR (||):
/* 
const value1 = true;
const value2 = false;

// Using || to check at least one condition
const result = value1 || value2;
console.log(result); // Output: true
 */

// 3 ------------------Nullish Coalescing Operator (??):

const defaultValue = "Default Value";
const userInput = null;

// Using ?? to provide a default value if userInput is null or undefined
const result = userInput ?? defaultValue;
console.log(result); // Output: Default Value

//In both && and ||, if the first operand is sufficient to determine the result, the second operand is not evaluated. This is the essence of short-circuiting. With ??, the right operand is only evaluated if the left operand is null or undefined.

//These operators are powerful tools for writing concise and expressive code, especially when dealing with conditional logic and default values.
